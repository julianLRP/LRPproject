Atrichoblast,AT4G00730,ANL2,"ANL2 (ANTHOCYANINLESS2) is a homeobox gene in Arabidopsis thaliana that plays a crucial role in root development. A mutation in the ANL2 gene causes the formation of extra cells called intervening cells (IV cells) between the cortical and epidermal layers of the primary root. ANL2 is required for the maintenance of epidermal cell lineage. In the context of drought stress response, ANL2 has been identified as a potentially important regulatory gene.(information obtained from"

Atrichoblast,AT1G68560,XYL1,"The XYL1 gene encodes the only α-xylosidase acting on xyloglucans in Arabidopsis thaliana. Xyloglucans are the major hemicellulose polysaccharide in primary cell walls of dicots and non-graminaceous monocots, and they connect the cellulose microfibril surface to affect cell wall mechanical properties. Mutation of XYL1 strongly influences seed size, seed germination, and fruit elongation. The expression of XYL1 is directly regulated in developing seeds and fruit by the MADS-box transcription factor SEEDSTICK (STK). XYL1 activity plays a role in maintaining cell stiffness and growth, confirming the importance of cell wall modulation in shaping organs (information obtained from Cell wall modifications by α-XYLOSIDASE1 are required for control of seed and fruit size in Arabidopsis)"
Atrichoblast,AT1G31950,TPS29,"The TPS29 gene was not found in the provided search results. However, the TPS1 gene in Arabidopsis thaliana is known, which encodes the enzyme TREHALOSE-6-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE1 (TPS1).
