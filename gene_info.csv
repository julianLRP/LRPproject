LRPspecific,AT1G73590,PIN1,"Benkova et al. PIN1 polarity rearrangement from the transverse to the lateral sides of cells correlated with the establishment of the auxin gradient with its maximum at the primordium tip. This relationship is crucial for primordium development. When PIN1 relocation was prevented, no DR5 gradients were established, and only a massive division of pericycle cells without clear separation into primordia was observed. This suggests that the coordinated rearrangement of PIN1 correlates with DR5 gradients and correct primordium development.",,,,,,,,,,,

LRPspecific,AT5G26930,GATA23,"De Rybel et al. GATA23 plays a key role in specifying pericycle cells to become lateral root founder cells prior to lateral root initiation. Its expression correlates with the auxin response oscillations in the basal meristem and is controlled by the auxin regulatory gene IAA28. GATA23 is specifically expressed in Xylem Pole Pericycle (XPP) cells before the first asymmetric division. A transgenic line expressing the GUS reporter under the regulation of the GATA23 promoter (termed pGATA23::GUS) showed expression to be root-specific and limited to pericycle cells at xylem poles. This expression was confined to early stages of lateral root formation, with strong expression in stage I and II primordia, reduced staining in stage III, and absence at later stages. The expression pattern suggests that GATA23 is involved in a process occurring prior to lateral root initiation. GATA23 controls lateral root founder cell identity. In the GATA23 RNAi line, there was a strong reduction in the number of stage I and II primordia and an overall decrease in the number of emerged and non-emerged primordia. In contrast, overexpression of GATA23 resulted in a significant increase in the amount of non-emerged primordia. This suggests that GATA23 promotes initiation by controlling founder cell identity of XPP cells. GATA23 expression in founder cells is correlated with oscillating auxin signaling maxima in the basal meristem. Synchronously germinated seedlings were evaluated for pDR5::GUS and pGATA23::GUS activity, indicating a relationship between GATA23 and auxin-responsive gene expression in the basal meristem.

LRPspecific,AT4G35550,ATWOX13,"Deveaux et al. AtWOX13 expression was detected during the early stages of lateral root (LR) formation in 10-day-old seedlings. The expression persisted during LR emergence. Initially, the expression was observed throughout the developing lateral root, but as the root developed, the expression became progressively restricted. It was particularly strong in the columella and the adjacent lateral root cap cells at a later developmental stage. In mature lateral roots or primary roots of 10-day-old seedlings, no expression was detected within the root tip. he expression pattern of AtWOX13 during plant development was further explored. In 5-day-old seedlings, AtWOX13 promoter activity was strong in both the cotyledon and root vasculatures, the pericycle, and in the stem cells of the primary root meristem. No GUS staining (indicative of gene expression) was detected in the division zone of the root. In the vegetative apex of 10-day-old seedlings, a strong expression was observed in the leaf primordia.
